Note that all of this is a first once over, there will likely still be issues
after some of the issues I've identified are resolved.

Also note that as of writing this I've just noticed that Rob has pushed fixes for some of
the items listed here, specifically:
- SCENARIOS
    - 020
    - 050
    - 130
    - 140
    - 150
- IMAGES
    - ftp-client
    - open-tracker
    - rtmp2 (added)
    - torrent-host
    - vsftpd
So these scenarios/images may now be working

Also updated all docker-compose commands to the new version which is 'docker compose'
as well as change the ANSI flag stuff

General: 
- What is the Bulgarian HTML page that is used everywhere?
- Why does the 020 capture siege end so much sooner than the 040 capture siege (I tried upping the threads of
    040 siege to 10 like in 020)
- Can we change all the shell scripts to a common name like capture.sh?
- Whats the difference between file_creator.sh and file_creator_HTTP.sh?
- Found out the hard way (arg!) that docker desktop breaks all the stuff that requires
    finding the PID of a container and then taking stuff from /proc/PID/ as docker desktop
    works much like a virtual machine and thus the PIDS arnt listed under /proc/PID/
- Would be good to create a common naming scheme for the names given to the docker images referenced in the docker-compose.yml
    files, as this has been a problem multiple times where the containers have had different names than
    what we have in the shell scripts



Is there functionality for setting labels such as benign and attack for use in training ML models?

Are we able to combine the different tcpdump datasources into one file?

Could we set up a tcpdump container situated where it can see all traffic flowing through the scenario
much like a NIDS would?



Possibilities:
- Move the huge volumes of HTML files to one folder and have all scenarios reference that folder
    instead of copying them (might need to change the files anyway as the templates dont exist anymore)
- Lots of re-use in docker-compose files but with slightly different names of stuff which is
    a bit of a nucince, e.g. nginxSSL and apacheSSL wget features use the same commands but name the
    source and output directorys differently


IMAGES:

- vsftpd still doesnt work, error with the mirror
    http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=container
    should also be noted that the last meaningful commit was 4 years ago now,
    https://github.com/fauria/docker-vsftpd
    Removed the old Dockerfile and added the base image as a standard image in the build process
    which seems to allow it to build the image

- ftp-client seems to have an issue with debian:jessie which I can assume is because it came out in 2015
    so I have updated it to debian:bullseye, does this need to be an old version for some malware to work?

- torrent-host also fails to build, updating python to python3 in the apt package list seems to do the trick
    again, is this ok?


CAPTURES:

020 - nginx:
- Why is siege loading http://nginx instead of localhost:8080?
- Are the index.html and default.conf files needed? They aren't referenced or added as a volume

021 - nginxwget:
- what does file_creator_HTTP actually do, it seems it never enters the if statement as FileRandomisation env variable
    is not provided, which causes the export FILENAME env variable to fail
- All the template HTML files just seem to return an error page, seems they dont exist anymore

022 - nginxssl
- Why have we removed the delay function?
- How is container_tc.sh using 'veth_full=$(get_container_veth $CONTAINER)' get_container_veth doesnt seem to exist
- Can we remove all the downloaded HTML files after it has run?
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported

040 - apache:
- Concurrent threads and requests seem to be unset which is maybe making the siege much slower
    than anticipated
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported

042 - apacheSSL:
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported
- Why are delays not enabled?
- ./container_tc.sh referenced but no file by that name is in the directory

050 - vsftpd:
- Fixed the images used as mentioned above
- Fixed issues with tcpdump commands containing () which are special characters and cause tcpdump
    to fail afaik. Replaced with not\(ip6 or arp or \(udp and \(src port 5353 or src port 57621\)\)\)
    Can they just be changed to match the new tcpdump image which contains the command as part of the image build?
- Fixed container names in capture-vsftpd.sh
    old: ContainerIDS=("capture-050-vsftpd_vsftpd_1" "capture-050-vsftpd_ftp-client_1")
    new: ContainerIDS=("capture-050-vsftpd-vsftpd-1" "capture-050-vsftpd-ftp-client-1")

080 - syncthing:
- Fixed same issue as above with the tcpdump commands
- Fixed same issue as above with container names
- Added depends_on sections for tcpdump containers
- Updated image to syncthing:131
- Maybe could get a better name than sync thing?
- Encountered some issues as regards no file at client2/conf/Sync

090 - openssh:
- Fixed same issue as above with the tcpdump commands
- Do we need the dummy container? Or can we just set depends_on to the tcpdumps respective images
- Again fixed incorrect naming of docker containers in respect to their entries in docker-compose.yml

100 - irc:
- None of the docker images used besides the tcpdump images actually exist, namely:
    thenotary/ircd-docker
    detlearsom/netcat
- Cant look further into this scenario before the images are provided

120 - heartbleed:
- Again broken tcpdump commands, same fix as before but need to look into just setting them up
    with the same commands some of the other tcpdump scenarios have
- Again missing image, namely:
    detlearsom/msfconsole
- Will return when image added

130 - bittorrent:
- transmission-create and transmission-remote seem to be from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TransmissionHowTo but no setup
    instructions provided. Added an installer script to the ./installs folder
- Seem to still be some issues with the scenario actually sharing stuff over the torrent
    but it does now at least run after installing the torrent-cli

140 - secureSQL and 150 - insecureSQL:
- Skipped as I've just noticed that Rob has pushed some fixes yesterday for quite a few of the scenarios
    here that I have gone over, will finish the ones he hasnt touched yet

190 - MPD:
- detlearsom/mpd image no longer seems to have modipy installed, Dockerfile is just 'FROM python:3.13.0-slim-bookworm'.
    There are other config files for the modipy stuff but not sure if they are used on image build?
- Due to lack of modipy scenario is not currently able to be started so other stuff cant be tested
- SCENARIO env variable needs set for tcpdump commands
- add_delays function (which is commented out) again references ./container_tc.sh which doesnt exist within the folder

240 - stream:
- Scenario not starting due to failure to get 'final childs PID from pipe', not sure as of yet what that means
- SCENARIO env variable needs to be set for tcpdump commands
- add_delays function (which is commented out) again references ./container_tc.sh which doesnt exist within the folder

260 - XXE:
- Same issues with tcpdump commands fixed
- Scenario cant run as the images for it dont exist in containers, namely:
    detlearsom/xxe
    detlearsom/python-requests
- No more to be done until images added

360 - rapidreset:
    - README is wrong for scenario
    - Why is the tcpdump image for apache commented out in docker-compose.yml?
    - tcpdump-trunc attempted to be used instead of tcpdump_trunc fixed
    - Otherwise seems to work fine assuming complete functionality is implemented
