General:
- What is the Bulgarian HTML page that is used everywhere?
- Why does the 020 capture siege end so much sooner than the 040 capture siege (I tried upping the threads of
    040 siege to 10 like in 020)
- Can we change all the shell scripts to a common name like capture.sh?
- Whats the difference between file_creator.sh and file_creator_HTTP.sh?


Improvements:
- Move the huge volumes of HTML files to one folder and have all scenarios reference that folder
    instead of copying them (might need to change the files anyway as the templates dont exist anymore)
- Lots of re-use in docker-compose files but with slightly different names of stuff which is
    a bit of a nucince, e.g. nginxSSL and apacheSSL wget features use the same commands but name the
    source and output directorys differently


IMAGES:

- vsftpd still doesnt work, error with the mirror
    http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=container
    should also be noted that the last meaningful commit was 4 years ago now,
    https://github.com/fauria/docker-vsftpd
    Removed the old Dockerfile and added the base image as a standard image in the build process
    which seems to allow it to build the image

- ftp-client seems to have an issue with debian:jessie which I can assume is because it came out in 2015
    so I have updated it to debian:bullseye, does this need to be an old version for some malware to work?

- torrent-host also fails to build, updating python to python3 in the apt package list seems to do the trick
    again, is this ok?


CAPTURES:

020 - nginx:
- Why is siege loading http://nginx instead of localhost:8080?
- Are the index.html and default.conf files needed? They aren't referenced or added as a volume

021 - nginxwget:
- what does file_creator_HTTP actually do, it seems it never enters the if statement as FileRandomisation env variable
    is not provided, which causes the export FILENAME env variable to fail
- All the template HTML files just seem to return an error page, seems they dont exist anymore

022 - nginxssl
- Why have we removed the delay function?
- How is container_tc.sh using 'veth_full=$(get_container_veth $CONTAINER)' get_container_veth doesnt seem to exist
- Can we remove all the downloaded HTML files after it has run?
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported

040 - apache:
- Concurrent threads and requests seem to be unset which is maybe making the siege much slower
    than anticipated
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported

042 - apacheSSL:
- SCENARIO env var needs to be exported
- Why are delays not enabled?
- ./container_tc.sh referenced but no file by that name is in the directory

050 - vsftpd:
- Lots of issues in this scenario
- Fixed the images used as mentioned above
- Fixed issues with tcpdump commands containing () which are special characters and cause tcpdump
    to fail afaik. Replaced with not\(ip6 or arp or \(udp and \(src port 5353 or src port 57621\)\)\)
    Can they just be changed to match the new tcpdump image which contains the command as part of the image build?
- Fixed container names in capture-vsftpd.sh
    old: ContainerIDS=("capture-050-vsftpd_vsftpd_1" "capture-050-vsftpd_ftp-client_1")
    new: ContainerIDS=("capture-050-vsftpd-vsftpd-1" "capture-050-vsftpd-ftp-client-1")
- Lots of other permission denied errors in:
    creating and removing files
    creating symbolic links
