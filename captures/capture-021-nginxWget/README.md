## Configuration

To configure the server, edit the `default.conf` file in the `conf` folder

## Website

To add your own static website, (download it using wget) put all the files in the `conf` folder. Then the homepage of that webpage must be renamed to `index.html`. 
The current setting uses the www.templated.co website.
